# C++ Dynamic Data Structures
## 1. Introduction

My name is Nikolay Valchanov. I am a student and a competitive programmer. 
This is my repository about Dynamic Data Structures made with C++. 
Here I am putting some of my implementations of data structures like 
stack, queue, linked list, etc.

## 2. Contents
  - Linked List
  - Vector
  - Queue 
  - Deque (Double-ended queue)

## 3. Directories

There are different folders for all unique data structures included in this repository.
Each folder contains :
  - Source code in C++ : The data structure with Constructor, Deconstructor and some of it's main functions (insert / remove and element, return the size, etc.). Comments in the code are included. 
  - Source code in C++ : Testing the data structure (Standard input and output)
  - Text file : "How the data structure works?" and "How to use the tester?"
